At work I lead a book club called Spaghetti Anonymous. It's really more like a
video club. We've been watching episodes of [Uncle Bob's Clean Code series](http://cleancoders.com/)
and having discussions about the content.

Today we watched [Episode VIII](http://cleancoders.com/codecast/clean-code-episode-8/show) which is an
overview of [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))
design.

The video covers

1. Software should be designed and built iteratively without huge up front planning.
2. The common design smells:i Rigidity, Fragility, Immobility, Viscosity, and Needless Complexity.
3. Why designs with dependencies that oppose the flow of control tend not to rot.
4. How object oriented design really about how key dependencies should be inverted in order to isolate the high level policy from the low level details.
